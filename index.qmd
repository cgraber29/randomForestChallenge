## üéØ Note on Python Usage

You have not been coached through setting up a Python environment.  **If using Python** You will need to set up a Python environment and install the necessary packages to run this code - takes about 15 minutes; see [https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html).  Alternatively, delete the Python code and only leave the remaining R code that is provided.  You can see the executed Python output at my GitHub pages site: [https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/](https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/).

## The Problem: Can Many Weak Learners Beat One Strong Learner?

**Core Question:** How does the number of trees in a random forest affect predictive accuracy, and how do random forests compare to simpler approaches like linear regression?

**The Challenge:** Individual decision trees are "weak learners" with limited predictive power. Random forests combine many weak trees to create a "strong learner" that generalizes better. But how many trees do we need? Do more trees always mean better performance, or is there a point of diminishing returns?

**Our Approach:** We'll compare random forests with different numbers of trees against linear regression and individual decision trees to understand the trade-offs between complexity and performance **for this dataset**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## Data and Methodology

We analyze the Ames Housing dataset, which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Anticipated Non-linear Relationships:** Real estate prices have complex, non-linear relationships between features (e.g., square footage in wealthy vs. poor zip codes affects price differently)
- **Mixed Data Types:** Contains both categorical (zipCode) and numerical variables
- **Real-world Complexity:** Captures the kind of messy, real-world data where ensemble methods excel

Since we anticipate non-linear relationships, random forests are well-suited to model the relationship between features and sale price.

## Student Analysis Section: The Power of More Trees {#student-analysis-section}

**Your Task:** Create visualizations and analysis to demonstrate the power of ensemble learning. You'll need to create three key components:

### 1. The Power of More Trees Visualization

**Create a visualization showing:**
- RMSE vs Number of Trees (both training and test data)
- R-squared vs Number of Trees
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualization

```{r}
#| label: power-of-trees-visualization-r
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 8

# Create data for visualization
trees <- c(1, 5, 25, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000)
rmse_test <- c(rmse_1_test, rmse_5_test, rmse_25_test, rmse_100_test, rmse_500_test, rmse_1000_test, rmse_2000_test, rmse_5000_test)
rmse_train <- c(rmse_1_train, rmse_5_train, rmse_25_train, rmse_100_train, rmse_500_train, rmse_1000_train, rmse_2000_train, rmse_5000_train)
r_squared <- c(r2_1, r2_5, r2_25, r2_100, r2_500, r2_1000, r2_2000, r2_5000)

# Create visualization data frame
viz_data <- data.frame(
  Trees = trees,
  RMSE_Test = rmse_test,
  RMSE_Train = rmse_train,
  R_squared = r_squared
)

# Create the visualization
library(ggplot2)

# RMSE Plot
p1 <- ggplot(viz_data, aes(x = Trees)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = RMSE_Test, color = "Test"), size = 1.2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = RMSE_Train, color = "Training"), size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = RMSE_Test, color = "Test"), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = RMSE_Train, color = "Training"), size = 2) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Test" = "#E31A1C", "Training" = "#1F78B4")) +
  labs(
    title = "RMSE vs Number of Trees",
    x = "Number of Trees (Log Scale)",
    y = "RMSE",
    color = "Dataset"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

# R-squared Plot
p2 <- ggplot(viz_data, aes(x = Trees, y = R_squared)) +
  geom_line(color = "#2E8B57", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "#2E8B57", size = 2) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(
    title = "R-squared vs Number of Trees",
    x = "Number of Trees (Log Scale)",
    y = "R-squared"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))

# Display plots separately (both with log scale on x-axis for better visualization)
print(p1)
print(p2)
```

**Analysis:**

The plots show that random forest performance improves dramatically in the first 25-100 trees, then levels off with diminishing returns. Beyond 100 trees, each additional tree provides smaller benefits. For this dataset, around 100-500 trees seems to be the sweet spot for performance without wasting computational resources.

### 2. Overfitting Visualization and Analysis

**Your Task:** Compare decision trees vs random forests in terms of overfitting.

**Create one visualization with two side-by-side plots showing:**
- Decision trees: How performance changes with tree complexity (max depth)
- Random forests: How performance changes with number of trees

```{r}
#| label: overfitting-analysis-r
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-height: 6

# Create decision trees with different max depths
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

# Decision trees with varying complexity
dt_1 <- rpart(SalePrice ~ ., data = train_data, maxdepth = 1)
dt_3 <- rpart(SalePrice ~ ., data = train_data, maxdepth = 3)
dt_5 <- rpart(SalePrice ~ ., data = train_data, maxdepth = 5)
dt_10 <- rpart(SalePrice ~ ., data = train_data, maxdepth = 10)
dt_15 <- rpart(SalePrice ~ ., data = train_data, maxdepth = 15)
dt_20 <- rpart(SalePrice ~ ., data = train_data, maxdepth = 20)

# Calculate RMSE for decision trees
dt_depths <- c(1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20)
dt_rmse_train <- c()
dt_rmse_test <- c()

dt_models <- list(dt_1, dt_3, dt_5, dt_10, dt_15, dt_20)

for(i in 1:length(dt_models)) {
  pred_train <- predict(dt_models[[i]], train_data)
  pred_test <- predict(dt_models[[i]], test_data)
  
  dt_rmse_train[i] <- sqrt(mean((train_data$SalePrice - pred_train)^2))
  dt_rmse_test[i] <- sqrt(mean((test_data$SalePrice - pred_test)^2))
}

# Random forest data (from previous analysis)
rf_trees <- c(1, 5, 25, 100, 500, 1000)
rf_rmse_train <- c(rmse_1_train, rmse_5_train, rmse_25_train, rmse_100_train, rmse_500_train, rmse_1000_train)
rf_rmse_test <- c(rmse_1_test, rmse_5_test, rmse_25_test, rmse_100_test, rmse_500_test, rmse_1000_test)

# Create data frames
dt_data <- data.frame(
  Complexity = dt_depths,
  RMSE_Train = dt_rmse_train,
  RMSE_Test = dt_rmse_test,
  Model = "Decision Tree"
)

rf_data <- data.frame(
  Complexity = rf_trees,
  RMSE_Train = rf_rmse_train,
  RMSE_Test = rf_rmse_test,
  Model = "Random Forest"
)

# Find common y-axis limits
all_rmse <- c(dt_rmse_train, dt_rmse_test, rf_rmse_train, rf_rmse_test)
y_min <- min(all_rmse) * 0.95
y_max <- max(all_rmse) * 1.05

# Create side-by-side visualization using base R
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2))

# Left plot: Decision Trees - Overfitting Problem
plot(dt_depths, dt_rmse_train, 
     type = "b", col = "#1F78B4", lwd = 2, pch = 16, cex = 1.2,
     xlab = "Max Depth", ylab = "RMSE", 
     main = "Decision Trees: Overfitting Problem",
     ylim = c(y_min, y_max),
     cex.main = 1.1, font.main = 2)
lines(dt_depths, dt_rmse_test, 
      type = "b", col = "#E31A1C", lwd = 2, pch = 17, cex = 1.2)
legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Training", "Test"), 
       col = c("#1F78B4", "#E31A1C"), 
       lty = 1, lwd = 2, pch = c(16, 17), cex = 0.9)
grid(col = "gray90", lty = 2)

# Right plot: Random Forest - No Overfitting
plot(rf_trees, rf_rmse_train, 
     type = "b", col = "#1F78B4", lwd = 2, pch = 16, cex = 1.2,
     xlab = "Number of Trees (Log Scale)", ylab = "RMSE", 
     main = "Random Forest: No Overfitting",
     ylim = c(y_min, y_max),
     log = "x", cex.main = 1.1, font.main = 2)
lines(rf_trees, rf_rmse_test, 
      type = "b", col = "#E31A1C", lwd = 2, pch = 17, cex = 1.2)
legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Training", "Test"), 
       col = c("#1F78B4", "#E31A1C"), 
       lty = 1, lwd = 2, pch = c(16, 17), cex = 0.9)
grid(col = "gray90", lty = 2)

# Reset plotting parameters
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

**Analysis:**

The left plot shows decision trees overfitting - training RMSE drops but test RMSE increases after depth 5. The right plot shows random forests don't have this problem - both training and test RMSE improve together. Random forests prevent overfitting through bootstrap sampling, random feature selection, and prediction averaging.

### 3. Linear Regression vs Random Forest Comparison

**Your Task:** Compare random forests to linear regression baseline.

**Create a comparison table showing:**
- Linear Regression RMSE
- Random Forest (1 tree) RMSE  
- Random Forest (100 trees) RMSE
- Random Forest (1000 trees) RMSE

```{r}
#| label: linear-regression-comparison-r
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

# Fit linear regression model
lm_model <- lm(SalePrice ~ ., data = train_data)

# Make predictions
lm_pred_test <- predict(lm_model, test_data)
lm_rmse_test <- sqrt(mean((test_data$SalePrice - lm_pred_test)^2))

# Calculate R-squared for linear regression
lm_r2 <- 1 - sum((test_data$SalePrice - lm_pred_test)^2) / sum((test_data$SalePrice - mean(test_data$SalePrice))^2)

# Create comparison table
comparison_data <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Linear Regression", "Random Forest (1 tree)", "Random Forest (100 trees)", "Random Forest (1000 trees)"),
  RMSE = c(lm_rmse_test, rmse_1_test, rmse_100_test, rmse_1000_test),
  R_squared = c(lm_r2, r2_1, r2_100, r2_1000)
)

# Calculate percentage improvements over linear regression
# For RMSE: lower is better, so improvement = (baseline - new) / baseline * 100
# For R-squared: higher is better, so improvement = (new - baseline) / baseline * 100
comparison_data$RMSE_Improvement <- round((lm_rmse_test - comparison_data$RMSE) / lm_rmse_test * 100, 2)
comparison_data$R2_Improvement <- round((comparison_data$R_squared - lm_r2) / lm_r2 * 100, 2)

# Create a clear comparison table
cat("\n")
cat(paste(rep("=", 80), collapse = ""), "\n")
cat("MODEL PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: Linear Regression vs Random Forest\n")
cat(paste(rep("=", 80), collapse = ""), "\n")
cat("\n")

# Format the table with clear headers
cat(sprintf("%-25s %-12s %-12s %-15s %-15s\n", 
            "Model", "RMSE", "R-squared", "RMSE Improvement", "R¬≤ Improvement"))
cat(sprintf("%-25s %-12s %-12s %-15s %-15s\n", 
            "-----", "----", "---------", "---------------", "-------------"))

# Print each model with formatted numbers
for(i in 1:nrow(comparison_data)) {
  cat(sprintf("%-25s %-12.0f %-12.3f %-15.1f%% %-15.1f%%\n",
              comparison_data$Model[i],
              comparison_data$RMSE[i],
              comparison_data$R_squared[i],
              comparison_data$RMSE_Improvement[i],
              comparison_data$R2_Improvement[i]))
}

cat("\n")
cat("Key Insights:\n")
cat("‚Ä¢ Linear Regression provides the baseline performance\n")
cat("‚Ä¢ Random Forest (1 tree) shows initial improvement over linear regression\n")
cat("‚Ä¢ Random Forest (100 trees) provides substantial gains with optimal efficiency\n")
cat("‚Ä¢ Random Forest (1000 trees) offers marginal additional improvement\n")
cat("\n")
cat("Note: Positive percentages indicate improvement over linear regression\n")
cat("      (Lower RMSE = better, Higher R-squared = better)\n")
cat(paste(rep("=", 80), collapse = ""), "\n")
```

**Analysis:**

Linear regression holds its own against random forests for this dataset, which is surprising. This makes sense because the Iowa housing data is pretty homogeneous, so linear relationships capture most of the patterns. Random forests are worth the complexity when you have non-linear relationships, but for linear data, simple linear regression might be better.
